Instructions
Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

Your tasks:

- Create an array called bills containing all 10 test bill values.

- Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals (tips and totals)

- Use the calcTip function we wrote before (included in the starter code) to calculate tips 
and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!

TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, and 52.
